    <h2 class="white"><u>Introduction</u></h2>
    <p>NVIDIA is a big tech company known for making powerful computer parts that are like brains for computers. These parts, called GPUs, help computers process graphics for things like video games and fancy visual effects. But NVIDIA does more than just gaming stuff; they also make parts that help with other tasks, like artificial intelligence (AI) and scientific research.</p>

    <h3 class="white"><u>Graphics Cards</u></h3>
    <p>NVIDIA's GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are like supercharged engines for computers, especially when it comes to handling graphics-heavy tasks. They're the reason why you can play high-definition video games, edit videos smoothly, and even run complex simulations for scientific research.
        These GPUs are built with thousands of tiny processing cores that work together to handle massive amounts of calculations simultaneously. This parallel processing power makes them incredibly fast at tasks like rendering 3D graphics, processing images and videos, and running artificial intelligence algorithms.They Have Different Types for different use cases</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Geforce</li>
        <li>Quadro</li>
        <li>Tesla</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="white">Why Nvidia?</h4>
    <p>I've always been a big fan of nvidia and their vision and recently through the sales of their AI chips, they were able to reach a valuation of 1.98 Trillion making them one of the BIGGEST Company in the world easily placing top 5. They Supply AI Chips to almost all data centers around the world and crushed business in FY 23, They Have a great work culture and is a company of the future.Hence the reason I Want to work there !</p>
